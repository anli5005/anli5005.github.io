# About me

<p class="lead">Hi! I'm Anthony Li.</p>

I'm a student who designs and develops various projects in my spare time. At present, I'm a student at the Bergen County Academies, and am in the Class of 2022.

I've been into programming from a very young age. I started out with basic HTML websites and Scratch projects, and I later learned how to create Mac and iOS apps using Objective-C, dynamic websites with HTML5, CSS3, and PHP, and rich backends using technologies such as Node.js, MongoDB, and Firebase.

Nowadays, the technologies that I work with include these:
* Web programming (HTML5, CSS3, JS)
* JS frameworks (Angular, VueJS)
* Server-side programming (Node.js, Java, Kotlin)
* iOS and Mac apps (Swift & Objective-C)
* Android apps
* WordPress & PHP

I also have experience in video editing and graphic design, and am now working on using machine learning and neural networks.
